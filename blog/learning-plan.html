          <p class="BlogContent">I feel that what I wrote the first time round was correct, but one more limitation is that there were times where I let my frustration get the best of me and I think that it could hinder me in bootcamp if I didn’t try to find a more healthy way to deal with it.

          <p class="BlogContent">I think there are two things that will be the biggest non-technical challenge. It will be staying on top of all the new material I feel like I could get overwhelmed as with all the new info, and the other thing would be sharing my ideas with the group in a team setting as I feel like my ideas may not be good enough.</p>

          <p class="BlogContent">My  expectation of the bootcamp team is that I would like to be treated with respect and with kindness and I would extend the same to others. Also, when I am stuck, I would hope they wouldn’t get too judgmental about how I ask my question.</p>

            A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
            <p class="BlogContent">One of my strengths when it comes to learning is that I am always willing to ask for help form other <br>
            To help me understand the current subject as I believe that it is better to work as team to obtain our goals when it comes to learning.</p>
            <p class="BlogContent">For limitations for learning is that I am dyslexic so when it comes write/typing things out it takes me much longer time to get what I want to say down and I end up worrying if I have spelt every thing right or have the right grammer so I spend way too much time on it just for my writing to still have errors that I don't see. Another thing I struggle with is the feeling of not being good enough in the work I am doing as I think I spend too much time compare what I am doing to others.</p>

        <div class="BlogMainC11">
            <h2 class="blogH2">
            What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
            <p class="BlogContent">A skill I would like to developed is presenting my work to a large group I am fine when it one on one but I get very nervous when their a bigger group of people to talk to.</p>

            <h2 class="blogH2">An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives?</h2>
            <p class="BlogContent">I it would best when interacting with others is to kind and respectful to other as this is the best way to build a solid network of people once you leave we leave Dev academy as well as you be working in teams so being able to work along another it caring environment will make you project go more smoothly.</p>

        <div class="BlogMainC14">
            <h2 class="blogH2">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</h2>
            <p class="BlogContent">When I feel like things are starting to build up I think the best way is just take a breath and take step away form the computer and have a small break maybe grab a bite to eat or go for a small walk outside or round the house/campus. Then when things have settle down ask for help form friends, class mates or facilitators.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="BlogMainC15">    
            <h2 class="blogH2">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way?</h2>
            <p class="BlogContent">As I have state before when I can't figure out things on my own even after spending time doing my own research on the internet then it best to reach out and ask for help.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="BlogMainC16">
            <h2 class="blogH2">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
            <p class="BlogContent">What I expect from the facilitation is to be treated with respect and to hear their honest opinions on my work as they are the best way for me to gauge if I am doing the best work I can do.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="BlogMainC17">    
            <h2 class="blogH2">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2>
            <p class="BlogContent">I feel like to the most part I need to keep my sleeping secluded to better stander as I feel I need to have 8 hours of full sleep other then that I feel I need to have just one day to myself so that I don't burn my self out coding non-stop.</p>
