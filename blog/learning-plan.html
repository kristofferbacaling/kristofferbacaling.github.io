          <h2 class="blogH2">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
           <p class="BlogContent"> My long term goal os to be finally able to make a decent living where I am able to finally pay off my student loans so I can focus on actually living a life and go travel all over the world when things have settle done. My current career pathway I would I would like to land a job as either front or back end developer but if I had to pick at of the two I would lean towards back end.</p>

            A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
            <p class="BlogContent">One of my strengths when it comes to learning is that I am always willing to ask for help form other <br>
            To help me understand the current subject as I believe that it is better to work as team to obtain our goals when it comes to learning.</p>
            <p class="BlogContent">For limitations for learning is that I am dyslexic so when it comes write/typing things out it takes me much longer time to get what I want to say down and I end up worrying if I have spelt every thing right or have the right grammer so I spend way too much time on it just for my writing to still have errors that I don't see. Another thing I struggle with is the feeling of not being good enough in the work I am doing as I think I spend too much time compare what I am doing to others.</p>

            What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
            <p class="BlogContent">A skill I would like to developed is presenting my work to a large group I am fine when it one on one but I get very nervous when their a bigger group of people to talk to.</p>

            <h2 class="blogH2">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</h2>
            <p class="BlogContent">When I feel like things are starting to build up I think the best way is just take a breath and take step away form the computer and have a small break maybe grab a bite to eat or go for a small walk outside or round the house/campus. Then when things have settle down ask for help form friends, class mates or facilitators.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="BlogMainC07">    
            <h2 class="blogH2">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way?</h2>
            <p class="BlogContent">As I have state before when I can't figure out things on my own even after spending time doing my own research on the internet then it best to reach out and ask for help.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="BlogMainC08">
            <h2 class="blogH2">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
            <p class="BlogContent">What I expect from the facilitation is to be treated with respect and to hear their honest opinions on my work as they are the best way for me to gauge if I am doing the best work I can do.</p>

            Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2>
            <p class="BlogContent">I feel like to the most part I need to keep my sleeping secluded to better stander as I feel I need to have 8 hours of full sleep other then that I feel I need to have just one day to myself so that I don't burn my self out coding non-stop.</p>
