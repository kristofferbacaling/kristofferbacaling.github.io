      <h2 class="blogH2">Blocked on a simple problem</h2>
        <p class="BlogContent">I had a problem with the deebees build-in method</p>
        <p class="BlogContent">I used a mix of differnt problem-solving techniques, the first one was to write out some Pseudocode to try and pice together what is it the deebees functions asking to do so I can get a greatly idea on how to start coding, I also used google to look up different methods that I could use to try and solve the problem so sites like MDN were a massive help and finally I reach out on the discord when ever I got stuck and with some of those helpful people I was able to solve the problem.</p>
        <p class="BlogContent">I felt a mix of furasthion and happiness when I was working tough out this problem as I was was on the right course when I finally saw what I had to do to get the code to work so I was glad that I was at least on the right track.</p>
        <p class="BlogContent">So I learnt that it does not have to be overly computed code as this problem was really solve in one line of code where the code I was doing was doing too much and and that I need to pull back and try to make my code more simple.</p>

    <div class="BlogMainC02">
      <h2 class="blogH2">Elegantly solved a problem</h2>
        <p class="BlogContent">Like before I used a mix of different techniques to solve the first part of the FizzBuzz repel,
        I started off with doing pseudocode by writing down the each step that I felt that the function needed then after reading trough the hits and then using google to look up how % works I was able to make the right if statement that could return the right response when asked.
        I felt really good for myself as it was able to solve it and I leant that code can be really fun when you really get to understand how things work.</p>

      <h2 class="blogH2">Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes</h2>
        <p class="BlogContent">
          <ul>
            <li>Pseudocode - I still like I am getting the hang of pseudocoding as it is a very helpful tool to use as it help me break down the functions needs into small bits.</li>
            <li>Trying something -  just trying things out is a great way to learn and I should use it more often.</li>
            <li>Rubber ducky method - so the rubber ducky method is to talk to a toy duck and try to explain what the code your working does so it can help clear things out when you say it out loud I have yet to use this method but am keen to try it out.</li>
            <li>Reading error messages -  reading errors is heart way to trying to figure out what wrong and that looking up the error on google help explain what going on.</li>
            <li>Console.logging - this is another great way to tack if the things your doing in your code is going to plan and to see if an error are coming up.</li>
            <li>Googling - the is my prime use of problem-solving tool but can be very time taxing but has always help me understand what is being done and to fix things.</li>
            <li>Asking your peers for help - as this course has being going on the more and more I try tan reach out to peers as getting someone else view tends to help clear things up for me.</li>
            <li>Asking coaches for help - have only ask a coaches once so far as I mostly get help form my peers but when I did get help for a coaches they were very helpful and would recommend going to them when you are truly suck.</li>
            <li>Improving your process with reflection -  after leaning more code and understanding it found that it I would like to go back to some of my old work and trying to make it better.</li>
          </ul>
