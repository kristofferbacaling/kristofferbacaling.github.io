      <h2 class ="blogH2">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
      <p class="BlogContent">That I have been going through my whole life, I have been going between a fixed and growth mindset my whole life and that I would like to stick more to a growth mindset. I can see that I can be very hard on myself as well and I am trying not to do that now and that people are on levels and that it is okay to be at my own level. One last thing that I learnt about myself is that my EQ is not as high as I thought I was and that I would love to work on a better understanding of others' feelings and may try out to help them.</p>

    <div class="BlogMainC02">
      <h2 class ="blogH2">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
      <p class="BlogContent">The role of values when it comes to learning and programming is that having a good set of values helps you set a good standard for yourself, it helps motivate you to do your best and produces work that you are proud of.
        <br>
        The role of empathy is, if you are better at understanding others, it helps foster a good work environment where the team gels well. They are able to work at their best as they feel safe. 
        <br>
        The role of self-awareness is being able to be aware of your strengths and limitations. Knowing what each is best helps you prepare for yourself and setting up needed support will help you learn to be more successful.</p>

        <h2 class="blogH2">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p class="BlogContent">What surprises me the most is the amount of self reflection that I would be doing and that I find really good. I have been learning a lot about myself.</p>

    <div class="BlogMainC04">
      <h2 class="blogH2">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
      <p class="BlogContent">The most challenging aspect of core learning is also the amount of self reflection. It can be really hard to look at yourself and try to understand what you are doing wrong and trying to fix it.</p>

    <div class="BlogMainC05">
      <h2 class="blogH2">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
      <p class="BlogContent">I think that Dev-Academy is spending a lot of time on these core skills in order to make us better suited for the workplaces and helps make us better in the eyes of any new potential employer.</p>

    <div class="BlogMainC06">
      <h2 class="blogH2">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?</h2>
      <p class="BlogContent">There are times that I do feel like I am wasting time, but I know in the long term that I would be better off with my core learning.</p>
