        <h2 class="blogH2">What is Javascript, HTML and CSS?</h2>
        <p class="BlogContent">
          So imagine that a web site is a car and so think of javascript as being the engine that helps power the web site Html is the body the contents the the site and CSS is the looks of the site.
          It is important for to have all three in oder to have a working web site.
          
          Javascript helps power all the interaction that a web site can do so if there a button that needs to be press java the one that make the button do the thing while css is how the button will look like.</p>

          <h2 class="blogH2">Control flow and loops</h2>
          <p class="BlogContent">Control flow is the order of how the code is process within java it is read form top to bottom preforming each action ask of it unless it told other wise. 
            <br>
            Loops is a function of java that will continue to perform an action of code till it has meet the loops condition then it will stops its loops.
            <br>
            Here is a example of control flow and loops in works playing a video game
            <ul>
            <li>First start by looking through a list of games  you want to play</li>
	          <li>Do you own the game if not move to buying the game and downloading it</li>
	          <li>If you do own the game is it downloaded to you computer</li>
	          <li>If not download game</li>
	          <li>Play the game</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
          </div>


          <div class="BlogMainC03">
            <h2 class="blogH2">What is the DOM</h2>
            <p class="BlogContent">DOM stands for Document Object Mode this helps define the structure of your web site, it break down you site down in something like a family tree with nodes that break off with the own children that contain elements
              of your site this helps the Java interact with the Html.</p>
              <p class="BlogContent">----------------------------</p>
              <p class="BlogContent" id ="exampleText"></p>
              <button class="button" id="krisButton"> DOM example </button>
            </div>

            <div class="BlogMainC04">
              <h2 class="blogH2">Arrays and object</object></h2>
              <p class="BlogContent">Both arrays and objects  works like a list of sort that contain data
                that can be access with your code in oder to be pull out later or modify in java. 
              <br>
              The difference of the two is that array store it data like this ['Kris', 'Ryan', 'John', 'Alice’]. 
              <br>
              So anything in [] is part of the array. Arrays counting at 0 note that  when you ask the array it will start it count a 1.
              <br>
              While object all it data is keep inside {} when then assign differnt key vales so that you can grab it at later point.
              <br>objectsInfo = {
              <br>fristName: 'Kris',
              <br>lastName: ‘Bacaling’,
              <br>email: 'kris@email.com',
              <br> address: ’No address found’
              <br>}
              </p>
              </div>

              <div class="BlogMainC05">
                <h2 class="blogH2">What are functions</h2>
                <p class="BlogContent">Functions act as the lifeblood of Javascript they are sets of orders that java will see in the code that will then run said code once it has being call uponwithin preform what ever the task that was set for them.
                <br> For example at my at my old work place in our team of cleaners we each are given a differnt task which we all do separately and when we each get our jobs done we move on to are next task. so each job task can be a function in java with set instructions that will follow till the task is done.
