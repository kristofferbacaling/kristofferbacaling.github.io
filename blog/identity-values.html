          <p class="BlogContent">I value the safety of my co-workers, so last year when I pushed for my team to tell our manger to let us stay home, they did listen to our request at first, then they told us an hour before work a week later that we had to be back on site.</p>

          <p class="BlogContent">Another example is when me and a friend of mine were threatened by a co-worker , who i managed to convince my friend that we should file a report to higher ups. Although we asked for it be anonymous, but we could not solve that issue, sadly.</p>

          <p class="BlogContent">I feel both of my cultures of both  being a New Zealander and Filipino is to be a hard work and that has influenced me to really try to the best worker possibly, another value that grew up with was to always be kind to others and to help them when they need it. I feel like that is just something everyone​ should strive to do in their life.</p>

          <p class="BlogContent">I strength that i have in my career was that i was a hard worker.

          <p class="BlogContent">Like I said before, one of my strengths is the willingness to listen to criticism to help improve your work. You need to listen to others, as that to me, is the key to success.</p>

        <div class="BlogMain">
          <h2 class="blogH2">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h2>
          <p class="BlogContent">One of my experiences at work where there was some major tension was with my last team of cleaner that I worked with. There was this one guy in that team that did not get along with anyone in our team and that was very difficult to work with. The strategy at the time I used was just to ignore and avoid as best as I could during our shifts as that was the easy way of not causing a scene with him, it was most effective as we got our jobs done on time but I feel like this was just avoiding the problem altogether I think it when been better with the whole team got together to discuss our iusse with him and our mangers so that we could have cultivate a safe work environment.</p>
